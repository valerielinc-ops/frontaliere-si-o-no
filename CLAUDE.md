# NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

These directives have the highest priority. No exceptions, workarounds, or "temporary solutions" may bypass them.

## Zero Tolerance on Quality

1. **NEVER lower quality thresholds, test tolerances, or validation criteria** as a workaround to pass a build or test. If a test fails, fix the root cause.
2. **NEVER downgrade errors to warnings** to unblock a deploy or pipeline. If something is an error, it stays an error until the underlying problem is fixed.
3. **All mandatory SEO parameters must always be present** on every job page in every locale: `baseSalary`, `postalCode`, `streetAddress`, `title`, `description`, `datePosted`, `hiringOrganization.name`, `jobLocation`, `employmentType`. If source data is missing, generate defaults — do not remove the check.
4. **Never accept thin content** (pages with <50 words in the body) as an acceptable solution. Every indexed page must have real content.

## Problem-Solving Approach

5. **Fix the root cause, not a workaround.** If a validation blocks the deploy, investigate why the data is non-conforming — do not disable the validation.
6. **If a test fails, the test is right until proven otherwise.** Do not modify the test to make it pass — fix the code the test verifies.
7. **If a parameter is documented as mandatory, it stays mandatory.** Do not make it optional for convenience.

## Workflow & Process

8. **Use Playwright for end-to-end tests**, not preview tools. Build + serve dist + Playwright.
9. **Linear tasks must reflect reality**: if a task is partially completed, close it and create a follow-up for what's missing.
10. **Always launch subagents with `model: "opus"`** (Claude Opus 4.6, max effort, 1M context). Never use Sonnet or Haiku for subagents — they need full codebase understanding and maximum reasoning capability.
11. **GitHub: always use `gh` CLI** for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, repos, actions, API calls). Never use any MCP GitHub tools — they route to GitHub Enterprise and will 404 on this repo. The `gh` CLI is pre-authenticated and targets `github.com` by default.

# Project Overview

**Frontaliere Ticino** is an Italian-language React SPA that helps Swiss-Italian cross-border workers ("frontalieri") compare the financial impact of living in Switzerland (Permit B) vs commuting from Italy (Permit G). It covers fiscal simulation, pension planning, health insurance, currency exchange, transport costs, job board, and more.

- **Live site**: GitHub Pages — `https://frontaliereticino.ch` (no `www`)
- **Primary language**: Italian (UI and domain), with i18n support for EN/DE/FR
- **Domain context**: Swiss/Italian tax law (2026 New Agreement), LAMal health insurance, AVS/LPP pensions, CHF-EUR exchange
- **Task management**: Linear (team "Frontaliere Ticino")

---

# Architecture

## Single-file SPA — No Router Library

There is **no React Router**. All routing is hand-rolled in `services/router.ts`:

- `App.tsx` holds **all navigation state** as local `useState` hooks (no Redux, no Context, no Zustand).
- URL paths use locale-aware slugs: Italian has no prefix (`/comparatori/cambio-valuta`), others get `/{lang}/...` (`/en/comparators/currency-exchange`).
- Navigation: `pushRoute(route)` calls `history.pushState`; `popstate` listener re-parses URL.

**Navigation Limits — HARD CAPS**

| Level | Max | Enforcement |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Top-level nav tabs | **6** | Do NOT add a 7th. New sections go as sub-tabs or footer-only links. |
| Sub-tabs per category | **8** | Before adding, verify the category isn't full. |

The 6 top-level tabs are fixed: **Calcolatore**, **Confronti**, **Fisco**, **Guida**, **Vita**, **Statistiche**. Additional tabs (`blog`, `job-board`, `forum`, `profile`, etc.) are accessible via footer links, search, or deep links only.

## Project Structure

```
App.tsx                 — Root component. All state lives here. ~2700 lines.
components/             — 116 React components across subdirectories
services/               — 40 service modules (stateless, exported functions)
  i18n.ts               — Translation orchestrator (lazy chunk loading)
  router.ts             — URL routing, slug tables, path building/parsing
  calculationService.ts — Swiss-Italian fiscal simulation engine
  firebase.ts           — Firebase init, Remote Config, App Check
  jobAlertService.ts    — Firestore CRUD for job alerts (feature-flagged)
  seoService.ts         — Meta tag management
scripts/                — 170+ Node.js scripts for CI/CD, crawling, data generation
  lib/                  — Shared infrastructure (ai-models, crawler-common, trigger-deploy)
data/                   — 34+ JSON data files (jobs, fuel prices, translations cache)
build-plugins/          — Vite build plugins (ogPages, jobsSeoPages, staticPages, fuelDailyPages, weeklyEmployers, jobMarketSnapshot, healthPremiumsLanding, orphanQueryLanding)
tests/                  — 163 test files (~21,842 LOC)
.github/workflows/      — 117 GitHub Actions workflows
```

## Translation Architecture (Chunked i18n)

Translations use a **chunked lazy-loading** system in `services/locales/`:
- `it-critical.ts` — ~80 above-the-fold keys, loaded SYNCHRONOUSLY (LCP fix)
- `{lang}-core.ts` / `{lang}-calculator.ts` / `{lang}-comparatori.ts` / etc. — lazy per-tab
- 4 languages: IT, EN, DE, FR (7-8 chunks each, 31 total)

## Key Design Decisions

- **No build-time secrets**: All API keys load from **Firebase Remote Config** at runtime via `scripts/load-rc-env.mjs`.
- **Feature flags via Firebase Remote Config**: New features gated by RC boolean parameters.
- **GitHub Pages SPA**: `public/404.html` redirects all paths to `index.html` via sessionStorage.
- **Canonical URL is `https://frontaliereticino.ch`** — no `www`.

# Tech Stack

React 19 + TypeScript ~5.8 + Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS 4 | Charts: Recharts 3 | Maps: Leaflet | PDF: jsPDF | Icons: lucide-react | Backend: Firebase (Analytics, RC, App Check, Firestore) | Testing: Vitest 4 + Testing Library | CI/CD: GitHub Actions (117 workflows) | Path alias: `@/*` → project root

# Developer Workflows

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server on port 3000
npm run build        # Production build → dist/
npm test             # npx vitest run (single run)
```

After any code change, always verify:
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript check
2. `npx vite build` — must exit 0
3. `npx vitest run` — all tests must pass

Pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) runs tests then build. Push is blocked if either fails.

---

# Testing

**Every new feature or component MUST include tests.** All 196 test files (15,588 tests) must pass at all times. A failing test is a blocker — fix the code, not the test.

What's mocked (in `tests/setup.tsx`): `window.matchMedia`, `localStorage`, `@/services/firebase`, `@/services/analytics`, `@/services/seoService`, `leaflet` / `react-leaflet`.

Tests that read `data/jobs.json` (gitignored): MUST exclude `needsRetranslation: true` jobs from locale completeness checks.

---

# SEO & Accessibility (quick reference)

- **Canonical URL**: `https://frontaliereticino.ch/` — no `www`, no trailing slash except root
- **Every new page** MUST generate static HTML in `dist/`, have SEO metadata, sitemap entry, and router slugs in all 4 locales
- **Contrast ratio**: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Never use `text-slate-400`** on light backgrounds — use `text-slate-500` or `text-slate-600`
- **Every button** must have an accessible name (text, `aria-label`, or `title`)
- **All `<img>` tags** must have `width`, `height`, and `alt` attributes
- **Dark mode**: NEVER use `dark:` color prefixes in component code. All colors use semantic tokens from `index.css` that auto-switch between light/dark via CSS custom properties. The only allowed `dark:` usage is `dark:prose-invert` (Tailwind Typography plugin). If you need a new color, add a semantic token to `index.css` — do not hardcode `dark:bg-*`, `dark:text-*`, `dark:border-*`, etc. See `index.css` `:root` / `html.dark` / `@theme` blocks for the full token inventory.

# Feature Flags (Firebase Remote Config)

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `ENABLE_JOB_ALERTS` | Job Alert Form UI + email sending | `false` |
| `KILL_FUEL_DAILY_LINKS` | Hide F6 links from SPA (footer/home banner/stats subtab/JobBoard sidebar) | `false` |
| `KILL_HEALTH_PREMIUMS_LINKS` | Hide F2 links from SPA | `false` |
| `KILL_JOB_MARKET_LINKS` | Hide F4 links from SPA | `false` |
| `KILL_WEEKLY_EMPLOYERS_LINKS` | Hide F5 links from SPA | `false` |
| `KILL_ORPHAN_LANDINGS_LINKS` | Hide F3b links from SPA | `false` |

The `KILL_*_LINKS` runtime kill-switches close the SPA link graph for the corresponding feature within ~1 min of flip (RC cache). Static HTML pages stay in `dist/` (Google doesn't de-index immediately). Full kill (de-indexing): use the `SKIP_*` env gates below + redeploy.

## Build-time env gates (SEO feature skip flags)

For fast local builds only. CI (`npm run build:ci`) exercises all plugins and must always exit 0 with every plugin enabled — never set any of these in CI.

| Env var | Skips |
|---------|-------|
| `SKIP_FUEL_DAILY=1` | F6 daily fuel-price pages + per-station + IT-city pages (`fuelDailyPages` plugin) |
| `SKIP_WEEKLY_EMPLOYERS=1` | F5 "aziende che assumono" weekly per-city + per-company×city hub (`weeklyEmployers` plugin) |
| `SKIP_JOB_MARKET_SNAPSHOT=1` | F4 weekly/monthly Ticino job-market snapshot + per-sector pages (`jobMarketSnapshot` plugin) |
| `SKIP_HEALTH_PREMIUMS=1` | F2 LAMal premiums-per-canton landing (`healthPremiumsLanding` plugin) |
| `SKIP_ORPHAN_LANDINGS=1` | F3b GSC orphan-query landing pages (`orphanQueryLanding` plugin) |
| `SKIP_BORDER_WAIT=1` | F8 border wait-time pages + webcam embeds (`borderWaitPages` plugin) |

# SEO content gate — text-to-HTML ratio

**Why it exists.** Semrush flags any page with `visibleText / totalHTML ≤ 10 %`
as "low text-to-HTML ratio". The Apr 2026 audit caught 1,193 such pages
(mostly fuel-daily, weekly-employers, health-premiums, job-board, and the SPA
shell for non-IT locales). These pages rank worse — search engines see lots of
markup wrapping very little content.

**Where it runs.** Two places:
- Local: `npm run audit:text-html-ratio` (after `npm run build`).
- CI: `Gate — text-to-HTML ratio` step in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`,
  blocking deploy on regression.

**The gate is a ratchet.** It compares the current dist/ offender count to
`data/text-html-ratio-baseline.json` and FAILS only when any feature bucket
goes UP. Improvements (count goes down) are always accepted.

**If the gate fails, here is the playbook:**

1. Reproduce locally: `npm run build && npm run audit:text-html-ratio`. The
   stderr names which feature bucket regressed.
2. Inspect the worst offenders for that bucket:
   ```
   node scripts/audit-text-html-ratio.mjs --feature=<name> --limit=20
   ```
3. Locate the build plugin that emits those pages (one per feature):

   | Feature bucket | Plugin / source |
   |---|---|
   | `fuel-daily` | `build-plugins/fuelDailyPagesPlugin.ts` |
   | `weekly-employers` / `weekly-employers-hub` | `build-plugins/weeklyEmployersPlugin.ts` |
   | `health-premiums` | `build-plugins/healthPremiumsLandingPlugin.ts` |
   | `job-board` | `build-plugins/jobsSeoPagesPlugin.ts` |
   | `blog` | `scripts/create-article.mjs` (article generator) |
   | `spa-locale` / `spa-other` | `build-plugins/htmlTemplate.ts` + SPA prerender shell |

4. Add **coherent, page-relevant** content — never filler. Acceptable kinds:
   methodology paragraph, FAQ block, scenario walk-through tied to the
   frontaliere use case, contextual cross-references to related comparators.
   **Never** add hidden text, repeated boilerplate, or invisible spans.
   Google penalises template-wide duplication and cloaking.
5. Rebuild and rerun the audit. Once the bucket count is lower, regenerate
   the baseline so the gate locks in the new floor:
   ```
   npm run audit:text-html-ratio:rebaseline
   ```
   Commit the updated `data/text-html-ratio-baseline.json` together with the
   template change in the same PR.

**Hard rule.** The baseline numbers must only ever **decrease**. Raising any
number means new pages have dropped below the 10 % threshold — fix that, do
not ratchet up.

# SEO content gate — orphaned pages in sitemaps

**Why it exists.** Semrush flagged 4,936 "orphaned pages in sitemaps" — pages
listed in any sitemap-*.xml but not reachable via internal `<a href>` BFS from
the homepage. Crawlers waste budget on these pages, and they tend to rank
worse since they lack site-structure support.

**Where it runs.** Two places:
- Local: `npm run audit:orphan-sitemap-pages` (after `npm run build`).
- CI: `Gate — orphan pages in sitemaps` step in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`,
  blocking deploy on regression.

**The gate is a ratchet.** It compares the current dist/ orphan count to
`data/orphan-pages-baseline.json` and FAILS only when any sitemap's orphan
count goes UP. Improvements (count drops) are always accepted but do NOT
auto-rebaseline; run `npm run audit:orphan-sitemap-pages:rebaseline` after
a deliberate improvement and commit the new baseline together with the fix.

**If the gate fails, here is the playbook:**

1. Reproduce locally: `npm run build && npm run audit:orphan-sitemap-pages`.
   Stdout names which sitemap regressed and shows top-10 newly-orphan URLs.
2. The cause is almost always one of:
   - **Static archive page lost an internal link** (e.g. nav widget removed).
     Fix the link source.
   - **New auto-generated content** (cron-published article/job) that no
     existing static page links to. Add a link from the relevant index
     (e.g. `/articoli-frontaliere/` → `/articoli-frontaliere/tutti/`) or
     update the archive pagination so the new content is reachable.
   - **Sitemap entry without HTML** (stale entry). Either restore the page
     or remove from the sitemap.
3. Rebuild and rerun the audit. Once the regression is gone:
   ```
   npm run audit:orphan-sitemap-pages:rebaseline
   ```
   Commit the updated baseline together with the fix in the same PR.

**Hard rule.** Per CLAUDE.md non-negotiable rule #5, **never** "fix" an
orphan by setting `noindex` without explicit approval. The default fix is
to **add internal links**.

# Completion Checklist — Before Every PR

- [ ] All tests pass: `npx vitest run`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npx vite build`
- [ ] If `t()` keys were added, all 4 locales have the translation
- [ ] No secrets in source code
- [ ] Accessibility rules followed (contrast, aria-labels, image dimensions)
- [ ] New pages have SEO metadata + sitemap entry + static HTML generated
- [ ] No `dark:` color prefixes — use semantic tokens from `index.css` (enforced by `no-dark-color-classes.test.ts`)
- [ ] If user-facing feature, new release entry in `WhatsNewModal.tsx`
- [ ] Text-to-HTML ratio gate passes: `npm run audit:text-html-ratio` (see *SEO content gate* above for the playbook on regression)

## Auto-push Rule

**Every time a task is completed successfully** (tests pass + build succeeds), **automatically commit and push to the remote repository** (`git push`). Do not wait for explicit user confirmation. If the push fails for a non-network reason, report the error.

# Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill tool as your FIRST action.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, brainstorming → `office-hours`
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken" → `investigate`
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → `ship`
- QA, test the site → `qa`
- Code review → `review`
- Design system, brand → `design-consultation`
- Visual audit, design polish → `design-review`
- Architecture review → `plan-eng-review`
- Checkpoint, resume → `checkpoint`
- Code quality, health check → `health`
